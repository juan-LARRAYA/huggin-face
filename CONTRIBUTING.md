## üîß Development Setup

Detailed setup instructions are available in [DEVELOPMENT.md](hf-vision-demo/DEVELOPMENT.md). Quick setup:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/huggin-face.git
cd huggin-face/hf-vision-demo

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start development server
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## üìè Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black backend/ *.py

# Lint with flake8
flake8 backend/ *.py --max-line-length=88

# Type checking with mypy
mypy backend/main.py
```

#### Code Style Guidelines

- **Line length**: Maximum 88 characters
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports, group by standard/third-party/local
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Add type hints for function parameters and returns
- **Variable names**: Use descriptive names, snake_case for variables and functions

#### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from PIL import Image


def process_image(image: Image.Image, model_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process an image using the specified model.
    
    Args:
        image: PIL Image object to process
        model_name: Name of the model to use for processing
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processing results
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If model_name is not supported
    """
    if model_name not in SUPPORTED_MODELS:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported model: {model_name}")
    
    # Process image...
    return {"model": model_name, "results": results}
```

### JavaScript Code Style

- **ES6+**: Use modern JavaScript features
- **Const/Let**: Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- **Arrow functions**: Use arrow functions for short functions
- **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over promises
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic

#### Example JavaScript Style

```javascript
// Good
const captureImage = async () => {
  try {
    const blob = await captureBlob();
    return blob;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to capture image:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Avoid
function captureImage() {
  return captureBlob().then(function(blob) {
    return blob;
  }).catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
}
```

### HTML/CSS Style

- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 elements
- **CSS Classes**: Use descriptive class names
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile compatibility
- **Accessibility**: Add proper ARIA labels and alt text
